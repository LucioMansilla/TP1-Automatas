# TP-Automatas

This is an academic project, which consists of the implementation of a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (AFND).

It is written in C and Python.

In C, it has different tests to test the operation of its operations.

## The executables associated with each test are listed below:

Test AFND to AFD: `./exec/test_afnd_to_afd` \
Test Build from dot: `./exec/test_build_from_dot`\
Test Build: `./exec/test_build`\
Test Write to dot: `./exec/test_write_to_dot`\
Test Pertains: `./exec/test_pertains`\
Test Lambda Closure: `./exec/test_lambda_closure`\
Test Move: `./exec/test_move`

## To run the tests:

```
cd C/tests ./run.sh
```


# PNG files:

In the `TP-AUTOMATAS/C/assets` directory, you can find the following PNG files:

- `AFD_1.png`
- `AFD_TP.png`
- `AFND_1.png`
- `AFND_TP.png`

These files were generated by running the `automata` program located in the `TP-AUTOMATAS/C/src` directory. This program reads an automaton from a `.dot` file, converts it from AFND to AFD, and writes the resulting automaton to another `.dot` file. You can run this program by passing it two arguments: the input `.dot` file and the output `.dot` file.


## To compile in C:

```
cd C
cmake -E make_directory build && cmake -E chdir build cmake .. && cmake --build build
```

## or:

```
cd C
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## For Python(Run):

```
cd Python
python3 report.py
```

# Note:

- Make sure to have Graphviz installed on your system before attempting to view the .dot files. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.graphviz.org/download/.

- You can verify if dot is available by running the following command: dot -V.

# To view .dot files:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the .dot file is located.
  (tests/) for example \
- Run the following command to generate an image file from the .dot file: dot -Tpng <filename>.dot -o <image_filename>.png
- The image file will be generated in the same directory where the .dot file is located.
